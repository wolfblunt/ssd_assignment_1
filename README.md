# Question 1
## Overview
- This program takes a number as an input (Let say N).
  - The driver function takes the input from the user and pass 2 to n numbers to the function twin_prime().
- Then it finds all the **Twin Primes** in the range 1 to N.
  - The function named "twin_prime()" checks that the number is prime or not.
- And the **digital root** of product of all twin primes as output.
  - this function takes those twin prime numbers and apply digital root and display it to final answer.

## Execution
- By executing following commands in the terminal (LINUX) you can run the program.

```
chmod +x q1.sh
./q1.sh
```

## Assumption
- no assumptions

***

# Question 2
## Overview
- This program Generates a Random Password with following characterstics:
  - Password length is not less than 6 characters and not more than 20 Characters.
  - Password is not a palindrome
  - Password does not have a lowercase alphabet and a number together in any order.
  - Password have at least one upper case alphabet, one lowercase alphabet, one
symbol, one number.
  - Password does not start with a symbol.
  - Password do not have two symbols together.
  - Password start with an uppercase alphabet or a lowercase alphabet.
  - Password does not end with an uppercase alphabet
  - Password do not have repetitive lowercase alphabets

## Execution
- By executing following commands in the terminal (LINUX) you can run the program.

```
chmod +x q2.sh
./q2.sh
```

## Assumption
- no assumptions

***

# Question 3
## Overview
- This program taking four-digit number as input, using at least two different digits.
- Then puting each digit in an array and sort that array using **arrSorted**.
- then taking 2 variables, in first variable storing all digit in ascending order and in second variable storing all digits in descending order.
- subtracting both the numbers.
- repeat above 3 steps till the **Kaprekar's constant i.e. 6174** comes.

## Execution
- By executing following commands in the terminal (LINUX) you can run the program.

```
chmod +x q3.sh
./q3.sh
```

## Assumption
- Always the input number will be in 4 digits.

 ***
# Question 4
## Overview
- This program generates **Palindrome days in DD-MM-YYYY when the year number is provided as input**
- By taking year as an input and stored in variable and reverse it, and treat that as day and month; and treat that as date.
- Then its checking for the neccesary condition to be a valid date, like:
  - leap year
  - date limit of particular months.
  - month should not be more than 12.


## Execution
- By executing following commands in the terminal (LINUX) you can run the program.

```
chmod +x q4.sh
./q4.sh
```

## Assumption
- The input year should not have leading zero.
- The input year will be 4 digit number.

 ***

 # Question 5
## Overview
- This program takes input number and returns its corresponding Lucas number Ln value as output.
- It uses iterative approach to calculate the result.
  

## Execution
- By executing following commands in the terminal (LINUX) you can run the program.

```
chmod +x q5.sh
./q5.sh
```

## Assumption
- No assumption
